![image2editable workflow](docs/images/readme-workflow-en.png)

image2editable turns images, PDFs, and screenshot-based PowerPoint slides into PowerPoint files that can be edited again. It is designed for courseware screenshots, design mockups, report pages, and image-based slides, reducing the work of recreating a page from scratch.

After conversion, you can edit recovered text, move separated visual elements, and keep refining the page in PowerPoint. When processing a mixed PPTX, existing editable content is retained in the file.

## Conversion examples

| Source | Editable result |
| :----: | :-------------: |
| ![Source 1](docs/images/demo-source-1.png) | ![Conversion result 1](docs/images/demo-result-1.png) |
| ![Source 2](docs/images/demo-source-2.png) | ![Conversion result 2](docs/images/demo-result-2.png) |
| ![Source 3](docs/images/demo-source-3.png) | ![Conversion result 3](docs/images/demo-result-3.png) |

**For the best visual result in a 16:9 PowerPoint deck, use a 16:9 input image when converting a single image.**

## Features

| Capability | What it does |
|------------|--------------|
| Editable text | Recovers readable text as native PowerPoint text boxes whenever possible. |
| Movable visual elements | Separates independently processable visuals into transparent image components that can be moved or replaced. |
| Mixed PPTX preservation | Native text, shapes, tables, charts, notes, and z-order that are not rebuilt remain unchanged. |
| Multiple inputs | Supports images, image directories, PDFs, image-based PPTX files, and mixed PPTX files. |
| Batch conversion | Converts multiple images or document pages into a multi-slide PPTX in order. |
| Quality gates | Accepts up to five plan batches per component repair cycle and stops that path early when quality does not improve or plans repeat; only reconstructed results that pass the quality gates are marked complete as editable conversions. |

## Before you start

- This is a tool for rebuilding **existing pages** into editable PowerPoint files. It does not create a new presentation from an article or outline.
- **⚠️ Complex visuals are usually kept as movable image components.** There is no 100% guarantee that all their internal elements can be restored as native PowerPoint shapes.

## Quick start

### **Let an Agent install it**

```text
Install the image-to-ppt Skill from https://github.com/DSY-Xueai/image2editable.
```

### Install with the **skills CLI**

```bash
npx skills add DSY-Xueai/image2editable --skill image-to-ppt
```

After installation, describe the task in an Agent such as Codex or Claude Code that supports Skills, vision, local file access, and tool calls. Images, PDFs, and `.pptx` files can be pasted or attached in the chat, or provided as local paths:

```text
# Codex
$image-to-ppt Convert input.pptx to an editable PPTX and preserve native objects that are not selected for reconstruction.
$image-to-ppt Convert input.png to an editable PPTX.
$image-to-ppt Convert <input.pdf> to an editable PPTX.

# Claude Code
/image-to-ppt Convert input.pptx to an editable PPTX and preserve native objects that are not selected for reconstruction.
/image-to-ppt Convert input.png to an editable PPTX.
/image-to-ppt Convert <input.pdf> to an editable PPTX.
```

## Failure policy: flattened fallback for image → PPTX

By default a page that cannot pass the editable-reconstruction quality gates fails the run (`reject`). For image input producing PPTX output you can opt into `hybrid`, which still delivers a deck: each unrecoverable page is flattened to a full-page picture of its source, while passing pages stay fully editable.

```bash
image2editable convert collage.png --failure-policy hybrid   # images → PPTX only
```

```python
runtime.convert("collage.png", failure_policy="hybrid")   # default "reject"
runtime.prepare_job("collage.png", failure_policy="hybrid")
```

Each variant gets a `<stem>.delivery-report.json` with `fully_editable` (`false` when any page was flattened), `degraded_pages`/`needs_route_a`, and `font_portability`. Every flattened page also keeps a bound Route A handoff under `pages/<id>/route-c/` (source + quality snapshots and `fallback-request.json` with `status: "awaiting_host"`). `awaiting_host` only queues the page — no Route A call is made — and errors are never silently degraded. See [docs/route-c.md](docs/route-c.md).

## Known limitations

- **⚠️ Review complex pages manually.** Decorative text, dense tables, gradients, and complex illustrations may not be restored pixel for pixel. Check text, component positions, and layout before delivery.
- Clear text and regular backgrounds generally reconstruct more reliably. Decorative text, dense tables, gradients, and complex illustrations are not guaranteed to match pixel for pixel.
- **💳 Conversion consumes the selected Agent's model tokens and context allowance.** Complex pages may require several diagnostic and repair rounds; actual usage depends on the Agent, model, and page complexity.
- **⏱️ Multi-page PDFs, complex pages, and high-resolution images take longer.** Each page goes through OCR, visual separation, reconstruction, and quality checks, with up to five plan batches per component repair cycle, and waits for Agent visual decisions.

## Supported inputs

| Input | Recommended route | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| Images or an image directory | Skill | PNG, JPG/JPEG, BMP, TIFF/TIF, and WebP are supported. Image directories include their direct image files only, excluding subfolders. |
| PDF | Skill | Pages are rendered and rebuilt into a multi-slide PPTX in order. |
| Image-based or mixed PPTX | Skill | Processable image pages are selected for reconstruction; unmatched native objects stay unchanged. |
